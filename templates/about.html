    This Leaderboard may encourage unhealthy competition. <br>
    It makes people focus on things like how easy tasks are. <br>
    How much time is being taken for reviews,etc. <br>
    Not the quality of the work involved. <br>
    I'm saying this because I've done it myself. <br>
    Committed not substandard code, but code which could've been better - because I wanted to finish and move on quickly.

    Please take the above in mind while looking at this leaderboard. Don't think
    just because you're fifth on your org. list, you'll lose. Focus on the quality
    instead of quantity.
